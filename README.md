# ðŸš€Flutter Swinging Balls AnimationðŸš€

The animation of synchronized swinging balls is achieved through the use of Flutter's animation framework. Key animation-related aspects include:

Animation Controllers: The app uses AnimationController instances to manage the animation of pendulums. These controllers dictate the timing and direction of pendulum swings.

Tween Animations: The Tween class is employed to define the range of values that each pendulum property (such as rotation) spans over during the animation.

RotationTransition: The RotationTransition widget is used to animate the swinging motion of each pendulum. It applies the appropriate rotations to mimic the swinging action.
